                          &quot;Meri, back with an update so soon?! What's the 
                          world coming to?!&quot;. And if you're not, well... 
                          maybe you should! That's right kiddie, there's been 
                          a crap-ton more goodies added to the ToT. Let's get 
                          right in to it, shall we?</p>
                        <p class="updateText">- First, as promised, here's a brand-new 
                          <a href="media/dbz_music_videos/index.html" class="updateLink">DBZ 
                          Music Video</a>! It's a Gohan character profile video 
                          made by me and <a href="http://www.daixex.com" target="_blank" class="updateLink">VegettoEX</a> 
                          called &quot;<a href="media/dbz_music_videos/index.html" class="updateLink">Succession</a>,&quot; 
                          and it takes place during the Cell Games. The video 
                          premiered at Anime Weekend Atlanta 2006 this past September. 
                          It was nominated for &quot;Best Character Profile&quot; 
                          and &quot;Best Sentimental&quot; in the Pro contest. 
                          Not only is this video (encoded as XviD) available on 
                          <a href="http://www.animemusicvideos.org/members/members_videoinfo.php?v=129944" target="_blank" class="updateLink">my 
                          animemusicvideos.org profile</a>, but there's also a

                        <p class="updateText">- Next up, there are 60 new images 
                          added to the <a href="images/screencaps/index.html" class="updateLink">Trunks 
                          Screencaps</a> section! Today, we've got images of Chibi 
                          Trunks from <a href="images/screencaps/movie13_1.html" class="updateLink">DBZ 
                          Movie 13</a>. Now, what makes this special, you ask? 
                          Well, these screencaps were <span class="smallText">taken 
                          from the anamorphic, widescreen, remastered Japanese 
                          DragonBox DVD release!</span> What this means for you 
                          is crystal clear images that make it look like this 
                          movie was animated yesterday, as opposed to 11 years 
                          ago. O_O Yeah, they're hot. Check 'em out.</p>
                        <p class="updateText">- And finally, brining on the real 
                          hottness for today is an update to the <a href="images/doujinshi/index.html" class="updateLink">Trunks 
                          Doujinshi</a> section! This past weekend at the MangaNEXT 
                          convention, I picked up a Trunks doujinshi I've been 
                          vying for for about, oh, let's say 8 years or so. Now 
                          that I finally got my obsessive hands on it, I've scanned 
                          a few images from the book, and put 'em up on the site. 
                          Hopefully, I can scan even more pics from this soon.</p>

                          EX: The Podcast</a>. This is a podcast related to anything

                          what I've been up to the last year, well, that's it. 
                          I've been co-hosting this DBZ podcast with VegettoEX 
                          and Julian of Daizenshuu EX for the past year, and will 
                          continue to do so as long as they are willing to have 
                          me on the show. If you've not checked it out yet, please 
                          give it a listen! It's good (not so clean) fun!</p>

                          to tell, yesterday's update was (rather obviously) an 
                          April Fools Day gag. :D There is a slight amount of 
                          truth to it, though! This is the 8th year anniversary 
                          of the site, and I will be moving to a new host in the 
                          near future (the URL of this site will remain the same). 
                          AND, I hope to redesign the site at some point in the 
                          very near future.</p>
                        <p class="updateText">Wow, I really need to actually update. 
                          I have tons of screencaps I'm sitting on, and lots of 
                          AMVs from late last year that I still need to post on 
                          the site. Whoops!</p>

                          Rather than direct my interests to Mirai Trunks from 
                          the DBZ universe, I've decided to switch things up a 
                          bit and focus on GT Trunks for a little bit. That said,

                          in 1998 or so. Going back and making screencaps from 
                          the domestically-released DVDs has been quite a trip 
                          down memory lane for me, so I quite enjoyed making this

                          the &quot;Lost Episodes&quot; here with its domestic 
                          release) will be coming out on DVD next week. Since 
                          I (oddly enough) really enjoy the early DBGT stuff, 
                          I'll be getting this disc. This means you can see some 
                          wacky GT Trunks screencaps next Tuesday or Wednesday, 
                          yay! Also, DBZ movie 9 (one of my two fave DBZ movies, 
                          next to movie 13) will be coming out soon, so they'll 
                          be plenty o' sexay screencaps when I get that DVD. Sadly, 
                          it's the last movie Mirai Trunks appears in, so I'm 
                          gonna go all out and take tons of images from that movie. 
                          :D Stay tuned! </p>

                          Ultimate Battle 22, DBZ Legends, Final Bout, and Budokai 
                          2. These new images are a helluva lot better looking

                          coming soon (in addition to more music videos debuting

                          again ;_;. Trust me, I have a lot of things waiting 
                          in the wings. I just have to get off my ass and make 
                          them, you'll see! In the meantime, I have an odd little 
                          update for you today. In the <a href="misc/features/index.html" class="updateLink">Special 
                          Features</a> section (located in <a href="misc/index.html" class="updateLink">Misc.</a>), 
                          you'll find a weird 11 MB sound file (WAV format) of 
                          a random guy calling in to a radio station claiming 
                          to have met a time traveller named Trunks. It truly 
                          must be heard to be believed. Thanks to Daitsuui for 
                          the submission!</p>
                        <p class="updateText">- As you may know, <a href="http://www.otakon.com" target="_blank" class="updateLink">Otakon</a>, 
                          the biggest anime convention on the East coast, is coming 
                          soon (August 8-10). As you also may know, I like to 
                          make music videos. So, as I typically do, I sent in 
                          a video this year for the music video contest. Well, 
                          a list of the finalists of those who will be in the 
                          Otakon Anime Music Video Contest has been released, 
                          and it seems as though my video made the cut! For the 
                          first time ever, a music video of mine will be played 
                          at the main contest at Otakon (which is really really 
                          cool, since *185* video submissions were sent in this 
                          year, and only 31 made the final cut).</p>
                        <p class="updateText">If you're gonna be going to the 
                          con, please check it out, I'll need all the support 
                          I can get! Feel free to cheer.... or something. My music 
                          video will be in the first category (Romance / Sentimental), 
                          and it's called &quot;Deceptive Passions.&quot; The 
                          anime is &quot;Fushigi Yuugi,&quot; and the song is 
                          called &quot;Pretty Girl (The Way)&quot; by Sugarcult. 
                          You should check out the contest this year, cuz they 
                          are a LOT of kick ass submissions this year, from what 
                          I've seen (especially in the Comedy category). Based 
                          on the <a href="http://www.otakon.com/happenings_schedule.html" class="updateLink">preliminary 
                          schedule of events</a> Otakon has put online, it looks 
                          like the main music video contest will be Friday night, 
                          11 PM - 1 AM, right after the MAT3K, in the main events 
                          room. If you can't make it then, the contest will replay 
                          at another time in a smaller video room. I hope you 
                          can make it! It'll be fun.</p>
                        <p class="updateText">Anyway, I'll be putting the video 
                          online for download immediately after Otakon, so stay 
                          tuned! Who knows, maybe I'll even put a short preview 
                          of it up in the coming days. :) <a href="http://www.daizex.com" class="updateLink">VegettoEX</a> 
                          and I will also be handing out CDs of all our new music 
                          videos, so if you see us, feel free to stop by and pick

                          I've updated. Sorry about that! I've been busy with 
                          my DDR track, and other music videos lately. But, now 
                          that I'm in between projects, here's an update for ya! 
                          I've completely re-made the <a href="images/screencaps/index.html" class="updateLink">Trunks

                          I re-did them because the old images from this episode 
                          were actual screen captures, rather than DVD-ripped 
                          images, like all the episodes are. So, enjoy the better 
                          quality images!</p>

                          As I've stated in previous posts, I've been busy with 
                          graduation, making my Otakon music video submission 
                          (which is finally done, whee), and now work.</p>

                          DBZ DVDs for making Trunks screencaps! I was on a roll 
                          before, and I intend to get back on it. I also want 
                          to make a fan art update soon. It's just a matter of 
                          time. In addition, with college over, and me dying to 
                          clear up some space, I plan on selling a bunch of my 
                          anime stuff, so expect a big eBay shop-o-rama of Meri

                          to make one's head spin! Hope you have fun looking at 
                          it all.</p>
                        <p class="updateText">- The main update of the day is 
                          114 new <a href="images/screencaps/index.html" class="updateLink">Trunks 
                          Screencaps</a>! Yes, the section is back online! As 
                          you can see, it's not as big as the screencaps section 
                          on the former site (401 now compared to 700+ before). 
                          This is because I have started this section from scratch. 
                          I deleted all my old crappy fansub and VHS screencaps 
                          (with the expection of &quot;Trunks from the Playdia 
                          Game,&quot; since those are rare), and I have begun 
                          replacing them ALL (and them some!) with DVD ripped/captured 
                          images. Dat's right, nothing but the best for you Trunks 
                          fans out there! The more high quality eye-candy, the 
                          better. So, what's new, you ask? Well, the DVD for the 
                          last episodes of Dragonball Z came out today. This disc 
                          features the last appearance of Chibi Trunks, and the 
                          first appearance of Teenage Chibi Trunks (wow, ain't 
                          that a contradiction in terms). Anywho, that said, I 
                          simply had to buy the DVD the day it came out (being 
                          yesterday). As a result, a butt-load of new DVD-ripped 
                          <a href="images/screencaps/index.html" class="updateLink">Trunks 
                          Screencaps</a> are now up! You can find some of <a href="images/screencaps/ep_273.html" class="updateLink">Chibi 
                          Trunks (episode 273)</a>, and of <a href="images/screencaps/ep_274.html" class="updateLink">Teenage 
                          Chibi Trunks (episodes 274</a>, <a href="images/screencaps/ep_275.html" class="updateLink">275</a>, 
                          <a href="images/screencaps/ep_276.html" class="updateLink">276</a><b>)</b>. 
                          In addition, starting from the very beginning, I have 
                          put up DVD screencaps of <a href="images/screencaps/ep_104.html" class="updateLink">Mirai 
                          Trunks' first appearance (episodes 104</a> and <a href="images/screencaps/ep_105_1.html" class="updateLink">105</a><b>)</b>. 
                          From this point on, I will be going in order of episode 
                          numbers and replacing all the Trunks Screencaps with 
                          DVD-version images. That's the big project I've got 
                          set up for myself.</p>
                        <p class="updateText">- And speaking of the new DBZ DVD 
                          that came out today (Kid Buu - &quot;A New Beginning&quot;), 
                          there was an interesting ad in the Extras portion of 
                          the DVD. It featured a little preview for DBGT, coming 
                          out in April. And I must say, it's pretty silly, and 
                          downright insulting to old fans. I've encoded a small 
                          MPEG file of the ad, as well as scanned pics of the 
                          DVD's crappy insert. You can find them all hosted on

                        <p class="updateText">- Greetings, and welcome to the 
                          all-new Temple O' Trunks at it's own kick-ass domain 
                          name, www.templeotrunks.com! Since March 2003 marks 
                          the 5-year anniversary of the ToT, I wanted to do something 
                          special by completely redesigning the site, as you can 
                          see. The site's also now at it's own easy-to-remember 
                          URL, so that's pretty special. I hope you'll enjoy the 
                          ride, now that you're here!</p>
                        <p class="updateText">So, what's different about the site 
                          now, do you ask? Well, first of all, some old goodies 
                          are now back. For example, the <b><a href="media/english_sounds/index.html"><span class="updateLink">English 
                          Trunks Sounds</span></a></b> are now ALL back up. In 
                          addition, nearly all dead links have been removed, giving 
                          you a more satisfying romp through the site. Furthermore, 
                          all old items that used to be on the main page have 
                          now been moved in to the all new <a href="misc/index.html" class="updateLink">Misc. 
                          section</a>. And, most obviously, the site is now easier 
                          to navigate (I hope)! If you get lost, please check 
                          the <a href="misc/site_map/index.html" class="updateLink">Site 
                          Map</a>.</p>
                        <p class="updateText">However, just because the Tot is 
                          all new and spiffy doesn't mean I'm done. Alas, this 
                          move is taking place during an insanely busy time during 
                          my life. I have lots of school work and music video 
                          work to do <i>while</i> I'm working on the site. As 
                          a result, a few sections of the Tot are not up yet, 
                          but will be in the coming weeks. Trunks Screencaps, 
                          Trunks Wallpapers and Fan Art are still under construction. 
                          Fortunately, I hope to have them all back up very soon.</p>
                        <p class="updateText">But fear not! I have some mad crazy 
                          fun stuff planned for the future of the Tot, in addition 
                          to putting up the aforementioned sections. I plan on 
                          making tons of new content and sections, so stay tuned. 
                          Also, the Trunks Screencaps section will get a total 
                          overhaul, featuring nothing but DVD-ripped images (hence 
                          it being down right now, since I'm still working on 
                          it). Don't miss out on all the goodness!</p>
                        <p class="updateText">As the leading site on Trunks on 
                          the web, I welcome you to the site! I hope you find
